        <h2> About us </h2>
        <hr class="block-divider">
        <p>The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider specifically for the
          American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and the English actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially
          supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart. The four actor-musicians were initially allowed only limited roles in the recording studio for the first few months of their five-year career as
          "the Monkees". This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series. Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced
          by Nesmith. All four contributed lead vocals to various tracks. They eventually fought for the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name, acting as musicians, singers, songwriters and producers. The television
          show was canceled in 1968 but the band continued to record music through 1971. A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, which led to a series of reunion tours and new records. The group has reunited and toured several times
          since then with different line-ups and varying degrees of success. After Jones died in February 2012, the surviving members reunited for a tour in November–December 2012 and again in 2013 for a 24-date tour. The Monkees continued to tour through
          their 2016 50th anniversary, with Dolenz and Tork forming the core of the band and Nesmith continuing to join them occasionally. Dolenz described The Monkees as initially being "a TV show about an imaginary band... that wanted to be the Beatles that
          was never successful". Ironically, the success of the show led to the actor-musicians becoming one of the most successful bands of the 1960s. The Monkees have sold more than 75 million records worldwide making them one of the biggest selling
          groups of all time with international hits, including "Last Train to Clarksville", "Pleasant Valley Sunday", "Daydream Believer", and "I'm a Believer". Newspapers and magazines reported that the Monkees outsold the Beatles and the Rolling Stones
          combined in 1967, but Nesmith claims in his autobiography Infinite Tuesday that it was a lie that he told a reporter.

          <p>From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was signed
            to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards.[14] Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer".</p>

          <p>In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was
            taught how to play properly. By the time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself.[5] He learned to play right-handed and left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes making his right
            leg weak..</p>

          <p>From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock band The Monkees, created for the television situation comedy of the same name. According to his May 2015 interview on Gilbert Gottfried's podcast, someone showed him a
            copy of the famous press advertisement asking for "four insane boys", so he applied for the job. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing blasé when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep his hair
            out of his eyes; producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered "Wool Hat", and called Nesmith back.</p>

          <p>Stephen Stills had auditioned for the new television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers felt his hair and teeth would not photograph well on camera.[10] They asked Stills if he knew of someone
            with a similar "open, Nordic look," and Stills suggested Tork audition for the part.[11] Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a fictitious pop band in the mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom written about
            the fictitious band. Tork was the oldest member of the group.</p>
